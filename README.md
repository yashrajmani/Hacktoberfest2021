## Your First Pull Request - Hacktoberfest
I created this project in the spirit of hacktoberfest so that you can do a very simple pull request and in the process you learn how to contribute to a project :smiley:
Note that this repository exists as a learning tool for new contributors to open-source, and pull requests to this won’t count toward Hacktoberfest! PR requests won't be accepted/merged.

### What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software. You have to register and make five pull requests to any github repo (including this one!) in the month of october. If you do that you get a tshirt :tshirt: and stickers for your laptop :computer: . Sounds interesting? Let's do it then!

### Wait...what is github?!

I get it. You are new to this whole thing. But don't worry, here is a great [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to help you understand.

### Contribution Guide

To Contribute in a proper way so that I can merge the pull request:

1. Star the repo! :star:

2. Fork it. (Important!) [What is that?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

3. Edit the README.md file.

4. Copy the below code and replace with your github user name. Add after the last one in the file.

   * [yourusernamehere](https://github.com/yourusernamehere)

5. Commit with a message. ( Or write "ALL IS WELL!") 

6. Make a pull request. [What is that?](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

7. Done! Welcome to the dark side!
